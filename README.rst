Overdub - Simple Multilayered Music Recording
=============================================

Overdub is a very simple Python program that allows you to do
unlimited overdubs into an audio buffer.

Conceptually it's like having a tape recorder without an erase head
except the tape is digital.

The program is currently undergoing a major rewrite. Check out the
undo branch for a fully working program.


Keyboard Controls
-----------------

::

    Enter          toggle recording / playing
    Space Bar      toggle playing / stopped
    Left Arrow     rewind
    Right Arrow    wind
    f              fullscreen

The solo and fast winding buttons found on the gamepad have no
equivalent on the keyboard. This is because I haven't yet found a way
to ignore key repeats in Tkinter.
