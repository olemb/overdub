Overdub - Simple Multilayered Music Recording
=============================================

Overdub is a very simple Python program that allows you to do
unlimited overdubs into an audio buffer.

Conceptually it's like having a tape recorder without an erase head.

Requires Python 3.8.


Keyboard Controls
-----------------

::

    Enter          toggle recording / playing
    Space Bar      toggle playing / stopped
    Left Arrow     rewind
    Right Arrow    wind
    f              fullscreen

There is also experimental support for control by gamepad and sustain
pedal. The solo and fast winding buttons found on the gamepad have no
equivalent on the keyboard. This is because I haven't yet found a way
to ignore key repeats in Tkinter.
